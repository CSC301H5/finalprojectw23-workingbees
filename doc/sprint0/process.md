# Team Organization

Using Trello, we split up the tasks amongst group members and set internal deadlines for when each task should be done. Generally, this means at least one day in advance before a significant deadline to leave time for checking over.

In terms of communication, we use Discord to present individual ideas to the team, and if there is consensus, we organize these ideas in Notion. We also use Notion as a space for collaborative brainstorming.

We divided the roles for Sprint 0, as shown on our Trello board. Generally, this choice was made on what each member wanted to work on for Sprint 1 or personal preference.

For Sprint 1, we are planning to organize our team as follows based on skills and desired involvement with the project:

- Calvin and Arjun will work on the backend.
- Jeremy, Joshua, Katty and Morgan will work on the front end.

# Decision Making

Decision-making was consensus-based. For the most part, we were on the same page about the assignment, with a few disagreements usually being easily resolved after both sides justified their reasoning. In the event we are unable to decide on anything, we intend to use a majority vote.

# Prioritizing User Stories

We prioritized user stories into three layers, defined as follows:

- A user story is "necessary" if it is required for our solution to be **functional**.
  - The ability to create and join a room, accept and reject users, join as a group, and initiate phases falls under this category.
- A user story is "important" if required for the **unique** **experience** we want to provide.
  - The ability to configure criteria, customize a temporary profile, and a group-forming algorithm all fall under this category.
- Otherwise, a user story is "nice-to-have," in which it adds a beneficial **side feature** or complementary **aesthetic**.
  - "Anonymous mode," being able to use an existing profile through login, and the ability to reuse room details all fall under this category.

In light of this criteria, each story's priority was immediately understood or quickly resolved through voiced discussion.

# Meetings

We allow meetings to take place on either Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday (days on which everyone is mostly free) and determine specifications (time and place) at least several hours in advance, usually in the morning or early afternoon.

We usually meet up 1-2 times per week, either in person or on Discord. It is in person if everyone (or the majority) is on campus. Otherwise, we hold it over Discord. Each meeting lasts 1-2 hours, and we take notes on the ideas discussed on Notion.

We spend this time addressing conflicts, collaboratively brainstorming, and discussing how we plan to move forward. To save time, we are implementing the habit of giving each person 10 minutes to review everyone else's work before the discussion starts. While we usually have a general topic for each meeting (something to be done), they are otherwise left unstructured to provide flexibility.

# Next Phase

There is a significant learning curve with the MERN stack since none of us have experience with it. As a result, we anticipate lots of extra time needed for each person to learn the basics during Sprint 1.

One lesson we will take forward to Sprint 1 is how to address interdependent tasks better. When discussing our respective Sprint 0 documents, it became apparent that we all had slightly different conceptions of what the final product would look like. As a result, some of the work conflicted in terms of information, which needed addressing after the fact.

Another thing our team will need to consider for the next phase is how to effectively communicate between two groups: the one working on the front end and the one working on the back end. The groups now have incomplete information on the other and will have to learn how to summarize their current situation.
