## Sprint Goal
The sprint goal is to get a basic functioning room for participants to join, which includes the ability to create a room and join it using its uniquely generated code and user authentication. This should also include the ability to specify the room's parameters, its name, and the host's name.

## User Stories
In particular, this goal refers to user stories 1, 4, and 6 (for room creation), 14 and 20 (for registration and login) and 17, 18, and 22 (for joining a room and creating a custom profile)

## Team Capacity
Our team capacity was generally measured in terms of the features we could implement. As a refined measurement of this, our team decided to make our story points based on a measure of time needed and overall importance (roughly an hour or two per story point). Our team capacity for this sprint was about 18 story points.

The specific task breakdown can be seen on our Trello board.

## Participants
The sprint plan meeting participants include all team members (Calvin, Arjun, Katty, Morgan, Jeremy, and Joshua), and each person has had a say in deciding our overall goals for the sprint.
