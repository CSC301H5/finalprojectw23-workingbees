## Release Goal
The release goal is to have a fully working web application and grouping algorithm available to the public by April 10th (sometime after our project is presented and final bugs are addressed).

## Scope of the Project
The scope of the project is to have users be able to create a custom profile for each room and for hosts to create custom rooms for participants with specific criteria they should answer for group making. We are looking to allow users to join as guests or register an account if they so desire, and users should also be able to join as an individual or as a group. Additional features outside of this, like chat rooms for groups after matchmaking, are considered a ‘nice-to-have’ and are not the main focus. For more detail, see the user stories included in the product backlog.

## Participants
The participants include all members of our team (Calvin, Arjun, Katty, Morgan, Jeremy, and Joshua), and each person has had a say in deciding the release goal and scope of the project.
