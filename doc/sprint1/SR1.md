**************************Participants**************************

- Calvin Arjun Katty Morgan Jeremy Joshua

********************************Unfinished tasks********************************

- Add joinHive as a story to be completed for sprint 2

******************************************Practices that should be continued******************************************

- Forming a well-thought-out system design through APIs before starting to implement features to ensure backend/frontend can develop to spec without needing the other side to implement their part simultaneously
- Regular meetings to keep others in the loop
- Planning out subtasks and communicating with each other in our sub-teams (frontend/backend)S

****************************************************************New practices to use next sprint****************************************************************

- Create subtask lists earlier in the sprint so we can plan out dependencies between stories and plan timelines more effectively
- Begin learning/research even earlier (e.g. we had to learn react/express in this sprint, next sprint we may need to learn socket programming.)

********************************************************************************************************************Harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint********************************************************************************************************************

- STARTING LATE
- Reduce duplication of work done in parallel branches to make merging simpler.
- Not testing code fully before committing/pushing, resulting in others pulling it without it being functional.

****************************************************************************************************What was your best/worst experience during sprint1****************************************************************************************************

- Worst: STARTING LATE
- Best: sleeping after finishing
