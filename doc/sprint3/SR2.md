**Participants**

- Calvin Arjun Katty Morgan Jeremy Joshua

***Unfinished tasks**

- Add group creation and hive question customization (via the web browser) as a story to be completed for sprint 3

**Practices that should be continued**

- Forming a well-thought-out system design through APIs before starting to implement features to ensure backend/frontend can develop to spec without needing the other side to implement their part simultaneously
- Regular meetings to keep others in the loop
- Planning out subtasks and communicating with each other in our sub-teams (frontend/backend)
- Create subtask lists earlier in the sprint so we can plan out dependencies between stories and plan timelines more effectively
- Begin relevant learning/research early

**New practices to use next sprint**

- Informing team members of discovered solutions to common problems and interesting things learned that could potentially be useful
- Establishing a publicly viewable schedule showing when each person is expected to start and finish their tasks and where they are currently at (Ex. not started, in progress, completed, stuck, etc.)

**Harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint**

- STARTING LATE
- Rarely communicating current progress with assigned tasks (most members had no clue where the others were at, even though the tasks were dependent on each other)

**What was your best/worst experience during sprint2**

- Worst: STARTING LATE
- Best: sleeping after finishing
