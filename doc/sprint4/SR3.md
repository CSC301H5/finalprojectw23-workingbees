**Participants**

- Calvin Arjun Katty Morgan Jeremy Joshua

***Unfinished tasks**

- Add frontend timers and the ability to accept and reject matching group recommendations as stories to be completed for sprint 4

**Practices that should be continued**

- Forming a well-thought-out system design through APIs before starting to implement features to ensure backend/frontend can develop to spec without needing the other side to implement their part simultaneously
- Regular meetings to keep others in the loop
- Planning out subtasks and communicating with each other in our sub-teams (frontend/backend)
- Create subtask lists earlier in the sprint so we can plan out dependencies between stories and plan timelines more effectively
- Begin relevant learning/research early
- Informing team members of discovered solutions to common problems and interesting things learned that could potentially be useful

**New practices to use next sprint**

- Create subteams of members working on similar tasks so they can share specific, related ideas about a given problem

**Harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint**

- STARTING LATE

**What was your best/worst experience during sprint2**

- Worst: STARTING LATE
- Best: sleeping after finishing
