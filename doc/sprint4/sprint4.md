## Sprint Goal
The sprint goal is to finish the project by designing an algorithm to create final groups of attendees and giving each group a chat room to communicate. We are also looking to provide the host with an overview of the groups made (like how many groups were made and how many people are in each).

## User Stories
In particular, this goal refers to user stories 11 (for the host to change to the correct phase), 12 and 13 (for final group creation and ability to get info about these groups) and 28 (chat rooms for each formed group).

## Team Capacity
Our team capacity was generally measured in terms of the features we could implement. As a refined measurement of this, our team decided to make our story points based on a measure of time needed and overall importance (roughly an hour or two per story point). Our team capacity for this sprint was about 20 story points, which equates to 3-4 story points per member.

## Task Breakdown
Arjun is responsible for implementing chat-related functionalities on backend.

Calvin is responsible for constructing an algorithm to create the final groups.

Katty is responsible for creating the host's waiting pages and a chat interface for the attendees.

Morgan is responsible for styling and setting up web sockets for the waiting pages.

Jeremy is responsible for creating a user interface for attendees to meet their newly assigned group.

Joshua is responsible for setting up a team viewing page where the host can oversee the formed groups.

## Spike
A significant anticipated spike is learning how to implement chat rooms effectively and creating an algorithm to generate groups according to the host's specifications.

## Participants
The sprint plan meeting participants include all team members (Calvin, Arjun, Katty, Morgan, Jeremy, and Joshua), and each person has had a say in deciding our overall goals for the sprint.
